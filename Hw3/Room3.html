     <p> The girls where speedily driving to there destination when, when Karen noticed that there was no other car on the road with them.</p>
      <p> Not only that, but they were headed down a road with no buildings either. Nothing was there except for the girls, the car, a guard house,a gate and a " Do Not Enter"</p>
      <p> sign on the gate. "Um... where are we?" nervously asked Karen. Jordan had noticed too that they were in a strage location. "Are we there yet?" Jordan asked.</p>
      <p> Both Jordan and Karens pulse began to quicken in fear. Where were they? How did they get here? Why are they in this strage place? " Oh, sorry about that," replied</p>
      <p>M.D. " I took a wrong turn and the g.p.s is making me do a uturn here." The nervous girls gave a sigh of relief, scolded M.D. for scaring them, and then looked forward</p>

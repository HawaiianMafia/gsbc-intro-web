     <h1>On the Road</h1>
     <p>The three amigas speed out of the parking lot leaving skid marks behind them. With M.D at the wheel they could make a 30 minute drive in 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>But, they needed to make a stop first at Safeway to buy some tooth paste. Brush your teeth ya nasty. Now the girls could be on their way to WingStop.</p>
     <p> The girsl <i>totally</i>begin talkingout useful information like homework, taxes, and voting. ( I know. These girls are lame!)</p>

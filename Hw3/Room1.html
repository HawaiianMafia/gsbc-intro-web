     <h1>Planning the Journey</h1>
     
     <p> Once upon a time, in a college near you, on a Sunday night after church, there was three starving girls, Karen, Jordan, and M.D.</p>
      <p>They debated all of 5 minutes of where they should go for dinner. Chick-fil-A? Sadly no, it was Sunday and Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays.</p>
	  <p>McDonalds? No, they just had that. In-and-Out? Eh. Then M.D had an epiphany.<b>WingStop!</b> Jordan and Karen quickly agreed to this excellent idea.</p>
	<p> They all grabbed their wallets and jackets and ran to the car anticipating delicious juicy wings.</p>
